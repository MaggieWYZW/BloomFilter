  1. BloomFilter.py contains the implementation of a simple Bloom filter.
  2. test.py contains the test script used to test the implementation. To run the test you can simply run this script following the syntax: python3 test.py [simple, speller, custom] 
  3. Some documentation is included in the notebook, Bloom Filter Documentation.ipynb (a HTML file is created for easy access)
  4. The two text files 'large_dictionary' and 'lalaland.txt' are used in the test.
