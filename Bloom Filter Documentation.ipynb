    "Unlike a set or a dictionary, a Bloom filter doesn't store the string itself, therefore it saves large memory space. However, this also limits its application as we cannot output or delete a string from the filter. Thus, Bloom filter is used only to check if an item exists or not. Some applications of Bloom filter are Chrome, Medium. Where Medium uses it to avoid recommending a user the blogs that he/she has already read. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two key components of a bloom filter is a bit array and hash functions. Simply, the Bloom filter uses hash functions to generate indices of a certain range.  The bits at given indices are set to one indicating if a string is already added. Arbitrary number of hash functions are used based on the size of the problem, as well as the size of the bit array. "

This is resolved by computing the optimal filter size according to desired false positive probability and expected number of total items to be stored ahead. Also, the optimal number of hash functions used is computed based on false positave probability given.\n",
    "- There is one assumption made in deceding the size of the filter: the expected number of strings to be stored in the filter equals to the size of the input list of strings. This satisfies the false positive rate using the minimum number of bits. However, in real-life application, the expected number of items stored in the filter is dependent on the problem.\n",
    "- The time complexity of add an item to the filter is constant. Although the actual runtime equals to the number of hash functions used, it is always constant given a desired false positive rate. This is because within the implementation, the number of hash functions used is computed by \n",
